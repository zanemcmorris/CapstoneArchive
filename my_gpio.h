/***************************************************************************
  This is a library for the BMP3XX temperature & pressure sensor

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit BMP388 Breakout
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/3966

  These sensors use I2C or SPI to communicate, 2 or 4 pins are required
  to interface.

  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products
